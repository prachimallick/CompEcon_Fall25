\section*{Introduction}
In this problem set, I use FDA Orange Book data to explore patterns of patent expirations
and generic entry. My eventual research question is whether patient-directed advertising
slows switching to generics after patent expiry. The three figures below set the stage.

\section*{Figure 1: Patent Expiration Distribution}

\captionof{figure}{This figure shows how many patents expire each year. I find a spike in 2027,
which represents a wave of patent expirations when many generics can enter. This is
precisely when firms may feel pressure to advertise directly to patients.}

\section*{Figure 2: Treatment vs. Control Trends}

\captionof{figure}{This figure compares patent expirations between large pharma firms (treatment)
and all other firms (control). This is a placeholder definition. The goal is to illustrate
how I will eventually compare advertising vs. non-advertising drugs in an
event study/DID framework.}

\section*{Figure 3: Proxy for Generic Entry}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig3.png}
\captionof{figure}{This figure plots the average number of products per ingredient over time.
Rising values reflect new generic entry, which creates opportunities for patients to switch.
Later, I will test if patient-directed advertising slows this rise.}
